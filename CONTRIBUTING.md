# Contributing to Obsidian Semantic MCP

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document covers everything you need to get started.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) — fast Python package manager
- Docker Desktop (for integration tests)
- Ollama running locally (`ollama serve`)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/celstnblacc/obsidian-semantic-mcp.git
cd obsidian-semantic-mcp
uv sync
```

### Run the test suite

```bash
uv run pytest -q                   # unit tests (no DB or Ollama needed)
OBSIDIAN_VAULT=/path/to/vault uv run python3 tests/test_setup.py   # prereq check
OBSIDIAN_VAULT=/path/to/vault uv run python3 tests/test_e2e.py      # end-to-end
```

All 183 unit tests must pass before submitting a PR.

## Code Style

- **Python:** Follow PEP 8. Line length: 100 chars.
- **Logging:** Use `%s` lazy format — no f-strings in log calls (matches project convention).
- **DB access:** Always use the `db_conn()` context manager — never call `psycopg2.connect()` directly.
- **Path safety:** Always use `_resolve_vault_path()` for user-supplied paths — no raw string joins.
- **Error handling:** `_handle_upsert` must catch all exceptions — the watchdog thread must never die.
